FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (grow-sparse) begin
  (grow-sparse) create "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) open "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) seek "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) write "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) close "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) open "testfile" for verification
  (grow-sparse) verified contents of "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) close "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (grow-sparse) begin
  (grow-sparse) create "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) open "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) seek "testfile"
  (grow-sparse) write "testfile"
- (grow-sparse) close "testfile"
- (grow-sparse) open "testfile" for verification
- (grow-sparse) verified contents of "testfile"
- (grow-sparse) close "testfile"
- (grow-sparse) end
